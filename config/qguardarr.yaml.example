# Qguardarr Configuration Example
# Copy this file to qguardarr.yaml and customize for your setup

global:
  # Basic settings
  update_interval: 300  # 5 minutes - how often to check and update limits
  active_torrent_threshold_kb: 10  # Track torrents uploading >10KB/s
  
  # Performance tuning
  max_api_calls_per_cycle: 500  # Limit API calls to prevent overload
  differential_threshold: 0.2  # Only update limits with >20% change
  
  # Rollout safety - start with 10% for testing, increase gradually
  rollout_percentage: 10  # Manage only 10% of torrents initially
  
  # Server settings
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8089

# qBittorrent Web UI connection
qbittorrent:
  host: "localhost"  # qBittorrent host
  port: 8080         # qBittorrent Web UI port
  username: "admin"  # qBittorrent username
  password: "${QBIT_PASSWORD}"  # Use environment variable for security
  timeout: 30        # Connection timeout in seconds

# Cross-seed integration (optional)
cross_seed:
  enabled: false  # Set to true to forward completion events
  url: "http://localhost:2468/api/webhook"
  api_key: "${CROSS_SEED_API_KEY}"  # Use environment variable
  timeout: 15

# Tracker definitions - customize for your trackers
trackers:
  # High priority private tracker
  - id: "premium"
    name: "Premium Private Tracker"
    pattern: ".*premium-tracker\\.com.*"  # Regex pattern to match tracker URLs
    max_upload_speed: 10485760  # 10 MB/s in bytes per second
    priority: 10  # Highest priority (1-10)
    
  # Standard private tracker  
  - id: "standard"  
    name: "Standard Private Tracker"
    pattern: ".*standard-tracker\\.org.*"
    max_upload_speed: 5242880  # 5 MB/s
    priority: 5
    
  # Public tracker with lower limits
  - id: "public"
    name: "Public Trackers"
    pattern: ".*(nyaa|eztv|rarbg).*"
    max_upload_speed: 1048576  # 1 MB/s
    priority: 2
    
  # Catch-all for unknown trackers (MUST BE LAST)
  - id: "default"
    name: "All Others"
    pattern: ".*"  # Matches everything - must be the last entry
    max_upload_speed: 2097152  # 2 MB/s (-1 for unlimited/no cap)
    priority: 1

# Rollback system settings
rollback:
  database_path: "./data/rollback.db"  # SQLite database for tracking changes
  track_all_changes: true  # Record all limit changes for rollback

# Logging configuration
logging:
  level: "INFO"  # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR
  file: "./logs/qguardarr.log"
  max_size_mb: 50  # Max log file size before rotation
  backup_count: 5  # Number of backup log files to keep

# Phase 1 Notes:
# - This implements hard limits only (no soft limits/borrowing yet)
# - Equal distribution within each tracker
# - Start with rollout_percentage: 10 for safety
# - Increase rollout_percentage gradually: 25, 50, 75, 100
# - Monitor memory usage and performance
# - Check logs for any errors or warnings
